<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Hi, my name is Patryk and I come from Poland. I've been living in the U.S. for most of my life, living in multiple cities like Boston, New York, and now Chicago. <br>
    I'm a single child, no brothers or sisters, and the only family I have here in the U.S. is just my parents. I am a commuter to Lewis University and will be majoring<br>
    in computer science. This class is my first step forwards towards my career.

<h2 style="color:darkblue">My Favorite Hobbies</h2>
<p>
    Some of my favorite hobbies are running, working out, biking, martial arts, and soccer. Despite them being hobbies, I do like to take these things seriously as well<br>
    Pretty much all of these things are very active, but I do find enjoyment in these things. Not only that, but it also helps me out in managing my stressors, as I find <br>
    The best way to get your head off of things is through some sort of sport/exercise.
